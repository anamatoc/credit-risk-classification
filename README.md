# Credit Risk Classification

The purpose of this analysis uses logistic regression to classify good clients from those who would be at high risk of defaulting on their potential obligation. Variants for this analysis include loan size, interest rate, income and debt-to-income ratio, number of accounts, derogatory marks and total debt.

In order for these data to influence the lending decision, there will be two classes. Class 0 for "credit healthy" clients and class 1 to classify clients with a "high credit risk".

The methods used include Logistic Regression (to fit and predict) and RandomOverSampler (balanced data to fit and predict).
